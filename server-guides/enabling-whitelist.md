# Enabling Whitelist

A whitelist is a way a server owner can make their server private, which can be used in many ways, from making an SMP just for friends, or for large servers when you want to develop new features while no other players are online.
To enable a whitelist on your server, first go to your server console. This can be found by going to the [Minekeep Dashboard](https://minekeep.net/servers) and selecting the cog icon next to your server name.

Once you are in the server console, there are a few commands you need to know:

`/whitelist on`
> This command enables the whitelist

`/whitelist off`
> This command disables the whitelist

`/whitelist add <player>`
> e.g. `/whitelist add SubGplayz`
> This command adds a player to the whitelist

`/whitelist remove <player>`
> e.g. `/whitelist remove SubGplayz`
> This command removes a player from the whitelist

`/whitelist list`
> This command lists all whitelisted players

These five commands allow you to enable and modify the whitelist on your server.
