This plugin can be any plugin that has support for bukkit, spigot or paper. These can be commonly found on websites like SpigotMC or Hangar. For this tutorial, I will be using the Simple TPA plugin on SpigotMC.","The first thing you do is download the jar file for your plugin. This can differ between plugin websites. On SpigotMC, this can be done by pressing the Download Now button, as shown below:","Once you have downloaded the plugin jar file, go to your MineKeep dashboard and select the server you want to install the plugin on, as shown below:","This will take us to our server console, however we want to go into the files of the server. To do this, click the files button above the server console, as shown below:","Now that we are in the server files, we can select the plugins folder, as that is where we want the plugin to be uploaded to, and then we press the upload button, as shown below:","In the upload window, select or drag in your plugin jar file, which will upload your plugin. The final thing you need to do is return to the console, stop the server, and start it back up again to load the plugin.","After that, you are finished! You may now use your plugin on your server, for example I will now be able to use the TPA command. You can confirm your plugin is working by running the command /plugins, and making sure your plugin is there, and that it is green."]}],[{"l":"Changing the seed"}],[{"l":"Enabling Whitelist","p":["A whitelist is a way a server owner can make their server private, which can be used in many ways, from making an SMP just for friends, or for large servers when you want to develop new features while no other players are online. To enable a whitelist on your server, first go to your server console. This can be found by going to the Minekeep Dashboard and selecting the cog icon next to your server name.","Once you are in the server console, there are a few commands you need to know:","/whitelist on","This command enables the whitelist","/whitelist off","This command disables the whitelist","/whitelist add player","e.g. /whitelist add SubGplayz This command adds a player to the whitelist","/whitelist remove player","e.g. /whitelist remove SubGplayz This command removes a player from the whitelist","/whitelist list","This command lists all whitelisted players","These five commands allow you to enable and modify the whitelist on your server."]}],[{"l":"Frequently Asked Questions"},{"i":"can-i-join-using-a-cracked-account","l":"Can I join using a cracked account?","p":["Cracked accounts are not able to join on MineKeep due to Minecraft's EULA.
